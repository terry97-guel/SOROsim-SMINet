This Folder contains InputJointUQ0 & InputJointUQt, functions that allow 
the user to input wrench values of the joints in case of Force/wrench joint
control or coordinates in case of angle/displacment controlled joints.

The CustomExtForce_Qspace, CustomActuation_Qspace and ComputePointForce 
functions calculate and convert user-defined custom forces, actuation forces
and external point forces to q space to be used to evaluate the static and
dynamic equilibrium function.
